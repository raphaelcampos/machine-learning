# Brief Description

This repositories aim at gathering some handy machine learning algorithms as an extension for the scikit-learn library
 and also provide some other algorithms that may useful to data scientist during data preparation and analysis.
 
# Algorithms

## Random Forest
  As an extension for forest-based methods of the scikit-learn, the repository provide the following algorithms:
  
### Random Forest Proximities
### Random Forest Missing Value Imputation
